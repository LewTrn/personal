            <h3>Hi, my name is Lewis and I'm a <strong>Front End Developer</strong></h3>
            <p>
              I got my first taste for front end development while studying at Imperial College London, developing web applications for engineering students. Since graduating in the summer, I have
              continued to pursue my passion for the front end, developing bold and engaging web applications and projects.

                Inspired by the Momentum Chrome extension, Dashpoint aims to provide users with a stylish, yet practical, dashboard experience for improving personal focus and workflow. The goal was
                to develop a lightweight, customisable dashboard that included tools such as to-do lists and calculators, as well as features such as local weather forecasts and custom bookmarks.
              </p>
              <p>
                This project was developed using vanilla JavaScript, leveraging the local storage and DOM manipulation capabilities to provide a fast, lightweight user experience. The application was
                built upon the Bulma CSS framework, and makes use of API data served by Unsplash and Dark Sky Weather.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dashpoint includes a range of custom workflow tools such as a notepad, to-do list, timer, calculator and colour converter. The application is fully responsive and supports desktop,
                tablet and mobile devices.

                Design Learning Objects aims to provide engineering students with new and compelling learning experiences to support the academic teaching at Imperial College London. The goal was to
                utilise front end technologies to improve the understanding of certain engineering topics by providing students with interactive learning tools and visual demonstrations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two static web applications were developed, each one addressing an individual engineering topic. Working closely with academics, various interactive features were introduced and
                implemented using libraries such as JQuery, p5.js and plotly.js. AWS was used to host each application and can be accessed through a home page â€” available at
                <a href="http://designlearningobjects.com/">designlearningobjects.com</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Design Learning Objects will be introduced to undergraduate students in October 2019 as part of the Imperial College Mechanical Engineering course.
