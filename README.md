# Dashpoint

Dashpoint is a dynamic personal dashboard for focus and productivity.

Inspired by the Momentum browser extension, Dashpoint provides users with a stylish, yet practical, start page for improving personal focus and workflow. The goal was to develop a lightweight, customisable dashboard focused on utility and user experience.
