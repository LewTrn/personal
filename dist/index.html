The twist, instead of drawing an image based on a prompt, the player creates a prompt to generate images using an AI model. Anyone can create a game, share an invite link and play with up to 6 players. The player with the most points after 3 rounds wins! </p> <p> Built on the T3 stack (Next.js, Prisma, tRPC, Tailwind CSS), Piction-ai-ry was designed to be accessible, quick to pick up and fun to play. Supported by integrations with Vercel and Supabase, anyone, anywhere can create a game and experience Piction-ai-ry with friends. Real-time subscriptions allow players to receive live updates in game and react to events as they happen. Built with scale in mind, Piction-ai-ry can support hundreds of concurrent games with several thousands of players, all playing in real time. </p> <p> Currently in Beta, Piction-ai-ry will recieve a full release in late 2022. </p> <aside> <div> <h4>Stack</h4> <p>TypeScript - Next.js - Postgres - Tailwind CSS</p> </div> <div> <h4>Services</h4> <p>Supabase - Imagekit.io - Vercel</p> </div> </aside> </div> </div> </div> <div class="video-container"> <video id="pictionairy-video" muted="" loop=""> <source src="/pictionairy.2a796000.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> </div> </article> <footer> <div> <a class="box wipe" href="https://pictionairy.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Visit Website</span></a> </div> </footer> </section>  <section id="dashpoint" class="fp-auto-height-responsive section"> <header> <h1>Portfolio</h1> </header> <div class="back-to-top"> <a class="anchor box square wipe" aria-label="Back to top"><span class="arrow up"></span></a> </div> <article> <div> <h2>Dashpoint</h2> <h3>A dynamic personal dashboard for focus and productivity</h3> <div class="content"> <div class="bar"></div> <div> <p> Inspired by the Momentum browser extension, Dashpoint provides users with a stylish, yet practical, start page for improving personal focus and workflow. The goal was to develop a lightweight, customisable dashboard focused on utility and user experience. Dashpoint offers a range of custom workflow tools, including a notepad, to-do list, timer, calculator and colour converter, as well as features such as local weather forecasts and custom bookmarks. </p> <p> This project was developed using vanilla JavaScript, leveraging local storage and DOM manipulation capabilities to deliver a fast, lightweight user experience. The application was built upon the Bulma CSS framework, and makes use of API data served by Unsplash and Dark Sky Weather. The application is fully responsive and supports desktop, tablet and mobile devices. </p> <aside> <div> <h4>Stack</h4> <p>HTML5 - CSS3 - Sass - JavaScript</p> </div> <div> <h4>Libraries / APIs</h4> <p>Bulma // Unsplash - <span>Dark Sky</span></p> </div> </aside> </div> </div> </div> <div> <img src="/dashpoint@2x.2178106a.png" srcset="/dashpoint.49b6abb9.png 1200w,/dashpoint@2x.2178106a.png 2400w" alt="Dashpoint mockup"> </div> </article> <footer> <div> <a class="box wipe" href="https://lewtrn.github.io/dashpoint/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Visit Website</span></a> <span></span> <a class="box wipe" href="https://github.com/LewTrn/dashpoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>View Source</span></a> </div> </footer> </section>  <section id="design" class="fp-auto-height-responsive section"> <header> <h1>Portfolio</h1> </header> <div class="back-to-top"> <a class="anchor box square wipe" aria-label="Back to top"><span class="arrow up"></span></a> </div> <article> <div> <h2>Design Learning Objects</h2> <h3> Interactive web applications and learning resources for engineering students </h3> <div class="content"> <div class="bar"></div> <div> <p> Design Learning Objects provides engineering students with new and compelling learning experiences to support the academic teaching at Imperial College London. The goal was to utilise front end technologies to help demonstrate core engineering principles and provide students with a set of interactive learning tools to reinforce their understanding. </p> <p> Two static web applications were developed, each one addressing an individual engineering topic. Working closely with academics, various interactive features were introduced and implemented using libraries such as JQuery, p5.js and Plotly.js. The project was hosted using AWS and is available at <a class="default" href="http://designlearningobjects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">www.designlearningobjects.com</a>. </p> <p> Design Learning Objects will be introduced to undergraduate students in October 2019 as part of the Imperial College Mechanical Engineering course. </p> <aside> <div> <h4>Stack</h4> <p>HTML5 - CSS3 - JavaScript</p> </div> <div> <h4>Libraries</h4> <p>JQuery - Bootstrap - p5.js - Plotly.js</p> </div> </aside> </div> </div> </div> <div> <img src="/design@2x.01f08b54.png" srcset="/design.7f311344.png 1200w,/design@2x.01f08b54.png 2400w" alt="Design Learning Objects mockup"> </div> </article> <footer> <div> <a class="box wipe" href="http://designlearningobjects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Visit Website</span></a> <span></span> <a class="box wipe" href="https://github.com/LewTrn/DesignLearningObjects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>View Source</span></a> </div> </footer> </section>  <section id="contact" class="fp-auto-height-responsive section"> <header> <h1>Contact</h1> </header> <div class="back-to-top"> <a class="anchor box square wipe" aria-label="Back to top"><span class="arrow up"></span></a> </div> <article> <div> <h2> Let's Get <br> In Touch </h2> <div class="content"> <div class="bar"></div> <div> <p>Interested in finding out more about me or my work?</p> <a class="underline" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewis-tran/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/linkedin.2702d4b3.svg" alt="LinkedIn"></a> <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/LewTrn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="/github.2d7ae8b7.svg" alt="GitHub"></a> </div> </div> </div> <form name="Contact Form" method="POST" data-netlify="true"> <input id="email" name="Email" type="email" placeholder="Your email address" aria-label="Email address"> <textarea id="message" name="Message" rows="5" placeholder="Your message" aria-label="Message"></textarea> <div data-netlify-recaptcha="true"></div> <button id="send" class="box wipe" type="submit" disabled=""> Send message </button> </form> </article> <footer> <span><span>Lewis Tran &nbsp;</span>I <script>document.write((new Date).getFullYear());</script></span> </footer> </section> </main> </body></html>
